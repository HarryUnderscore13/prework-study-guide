# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a webpage built to priovide details on the information learnt during the prework of the course. It was built as both a place to store the information and also learn coding while creating it. It solved the prolem of not having an easy to access place to store all the information learnt during the prework. Building it helped me learn more HTML and CSS than i knew before and put it into practical use, as well as giving me an introduction into JavaScript.
